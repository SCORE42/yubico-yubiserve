Installation is pretty simple, you just have to install few python packages:

Under Debian, you can run:
{{{
apt-get install python python-sqlite python-crypto python-openssl
}}}
That's all, yes!

Then, you have to generate the certificate for ssl validation, so if you don't
already have a certificate you have to issue the following command to self-sign
one:
openssl req -new -x509 -keyout yubiserve.pem -out yubiserve.pem -days 365 -nodes
That's all, yes!
After installing the needed packages, you just need to extract the files
to a directory, add the keys and launch the server (or, if you prefer
you can launch the server before adding the keys, it doesn't matter).
