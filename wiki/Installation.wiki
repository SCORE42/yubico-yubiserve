= Installation =

Installation is pretty simple, you just have to install few python packages:
Under Debian, you can run:
apt-get install python python-sqlite python-crypto
That's all, yes!
After installing the needed packages, you just need to extract the files
to a directory, add the keys and launch the server (or, if you prefer
you can launch the server before adding the keys, it doesn't matter).
